        <h2 class="blog-post-title">Learning About Basketball</h2>

     
          <h2>History</h2>
        <p>In early December 1891, Canadian James Naismith,[4] a physical education professor and instructor at the International Young Men's Christian Association Training School[5] (YMCA) (today, Springfield College) in Springfield, Massachusetts, was trying to keep his gym class active on a rainy day. He sought a vigorous indoor game to keep his students occupied and at proper levels of fitness during the long New England winters. After rejecting other ideas as either too rough or poorly suited to walled-in gymnasiums, he wrote the basic rules and nailed a peach basket onto a 10-foot (3.0 m) elevated track. In contrast with modern basketball nets, this peach basket retained its bottom, and balls had to be retrieved manually after each "basket" or point scored; this proved inefficient, however, so the bottom of the basket was removed,[6] allowing the balls to be poked out with a long dowel each time.</p>
    
          <h3>Rules and Regulations</h3>
        <p>Measurements and time limits discussed in this section often vary among tournaments and organizations; international and NBA rules are used in this section.

    The object of the game is to outscore one's opponents by throwing the ball through the opponents' basket from above while preventing the opponents from doing so on their own. An attempt to score in this way is called a shot. A successful shot is worth two points, or three points if it is taken from beyond the three-point arc 6.75 metres (22 ft 2 in) from the basket in international games[citation needed] and 23 feet 9 inches (7.24 m) in NBA games.[34] A one-point shot can be earned when shooting from the foul line after a foul is made.</p>
        
          <h3>Positions</h3>
    <ul>
          <li>Point guard (often called the "1") : usually the fastest player on the team, organizes the team's offense by controlling the ball and making sure that it gets to the right player at the right time.</li>
          
            <li>Shooting guard (the "2") : creates a high volume of shots on offense, mainly long-ranged; and guards the opponent's best perimeter player on defense.</li>
          
            <li>Small forward (the "3") : often primarily responsible for scoring points via cuts to the basket and dribble penetration; on defense seeks rebounds and steals, but sometimes plays more actively.</li>
            
            <li>Power forward (the "4"): plays offensively often with their back to the basket; on defense, plays under the basket (in a zone defense) or against the opposing power forward (in man-to-man defense).</li>
            
            <li>Power forward (the "4"): plays offensively often with their back to the basket; on defense, plays under the basket (in a zone defense) or against the opposing power forward (in man-to-man defense).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="blog-post-title">Shooting</h2>
        
          <p>Shooting is the act of attempting to score points by throwing the ball through the basket, methods varying with players and situations.

Typically, a player faces the basket with both feet facing the basket. A player will rest the ball on the fingertips of the dominant hand (the shooting arm) slightly above the head, with the other hand supporting the side of the ball. The ball is usually shot by jumping (though not always) and extending the shooting arm. The shooting arm, fully extended with the wrist fully bent, is held stationary for a moment following the release of the ball, known as a follow-through. Players often try to put a steady backspin on the ball to absorb its impact with the rim. The ideal trajectory of the shot is somewhat controversial, but generally a proper arc is recommended. Players may shoot directly into the basket or may use the backboard to redirect the ball into the basket.</p>

      <div class="blog-post">
        <h2 class="blog-post-title">Race and Ethincity</h2>
       
          <p>The composition of race and ethnicity in the National Basketball Association (NBA) has changed throughout the league's history. For the 2014-2015 season, international players comprised 21.3 percent of NBA rosters. The same year, the racial breakdown of the NBA was:[62]</p>

          <ul>
          <li>African 74.4 percent</li>
          <li>Caucasian 23.3 percent</li>
          <li>Latino (of any race) 1.8 percent</li>
          <li>Asian and "other" 0.2 percent</li>
          </ul>
              
            <p>The first non-white player entered the league in 1947.[63] Wataru Misaka debuted in 1947â€“48 as the first non-white player and the first player of Asian descent to play in the league.[63] Yao Ming became the first East Asian first overall pick, when he was selected by the Houston Rockets in the 2002 NBA draft.</p>
