    <h1>Race and Ethincity</h1>
    
    
    <p>The composition of race and ethnicity in the National Basketball Association (NBA) has changed throughout the league's history. For the 2014-2015 season, international players comprised 21.3 percent of NBA rosters. The same year, the racial breakdown of the NBA was:[62]</p>

    <li>African 74.4 percent</li>
    <li>Caucasian 23.3 percent</li>
    <li>Latino (of any race) 1.8 percent</li>
    <li>Asian and "other" 0.2 percent</li>

    <p> The first non-white player entered the league in 1947.[63] Wataru Misaka debuted in 1947–48 as the first non-white player and the first player of Asian descent to play in the league.[63] Yao Ming became the first East Asian first overall pick, when he was selected by the Houston Rockets in the 2002 NBA draft.</p>

    <p>In 2011, Richard Lapchick with The Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport (TIDES) of the University of Central Florida reported in their annual Racial and Gender Report Card that 17 percent of the league's players were white, the lowest since the report began in 1990.[a][64][66][67] Hall of Fame player and Indiana Pacers president of basketball operations Larry Bird, who is white, stated in 2004 that the league needed more white players since the league's fans are mostly white. "And if you just had a couple of white guys in there, you might get them [the fans, not the guys] a little excited. But it is a black man's game, and it will be forever. I mean, the greatest athletes in the world are African-American," said Bird.[68][69]</p>

    <p>More recently, a number of commentators have remarked on the league's dwindling number of white American players. While a TIDES study found that the NBA was 18.3% white in the 2015–16 season, this number also included non-Americans, most notably Europeans. During the entire 1996–97 season, only three NBA teams did not field an American-born white; on the opening day of the 2016–17 season, eight teams did not have a white American on their roster, and an additional 10 teams had only one. At the latter point in time, fewer than 10% of NBA players were American-born whites (43 out of a possible 450).[70]</p>

    <p>These proportions have been suggested to be the result of basketball's relatively minor importance in white American culture. As of 2014, white interest in the NBA remains the lowest among all racial groups, with African Americans and Asian Americans spending the most time watching basketball, followed by Hispanics (of any race).[71] Furthermore, according to a Nielsen's survey, the NBA has the highest share of black viewers, with 45 percent of its viewers being black and only about 40 percent of viewers being white, making it the only top North American sport that doesn't have a white majority audience.[72] The NBAs popularity further declined among whites, who during the 2016-17 season, only made up 34% of the overall viewership. At the same time the black viewership increased to 47 percent, while hispanic (of any race) stood at 11 percent and asian viewership stood at eight percent.[73]</p>
